      <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four Privet Drive is proud of himself claimed to be
         fully
         normal , but thank you very much . Are at last from someone who expected to be tangled
         in voľačoho special or mysterious , because such a thing considered simply as be
         excluded .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mr. Dursley was the director of Vrtamex , which made drills . It was a big , fat man
         with
         almost no neck , but with a huge mustache . Mrs. Dursley was again poor blonde with
         a
         neck twice as long as usual , what was in her case tremendously practical - a large
         part
         of their free time in fact spent by him craning over garden fence and spy on neighbors
         .
         The Dursleys had a small son , which were believe that this is the coolest guy in
         the
         world .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but also had one terrible secret, and were
         afraid to disclose . Assumption that there is someone out about the Potters , probably
         would not survive . lady Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister , but both are seen for
         several years , actually Mrs. Dursley was pretended that any sister does , because
         her
         sister with her team men were so -error nedursleyovskí the worse it could be even
         longer
         . Dursleys striasalo just thinking about what the neighbors would say if the Potters
         appeared in their street . The Dursleys knew that the Potters have a young son ,
         However, it has never seen before. This guy was another reason why the Potters did
         not
         desire encounter did not want Dudley with the kid they socialized .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Dursleys will one day wake up to the bleak , gray Tuesday when initiating our
         story ,
         but nothing cloudy sky indications that across the country will happen strange and
         mysterious things . Mr. Dursley just a tie to work his most boring tie and croon ,
         while
         Mrs. Dursley cramming defending and screaming Dudley into baby chair and cheerfully
         at
         the štebotala .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Neither of them noticed a large , tan owl , who just flew forefront of their window
         .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>About half past eight , Mr Dursley grabbed his briefcase , kissed on the cheek Mrs.
         Dursley attempted the same thing in Dudley , but missed , because Dudley had just
         seized
         a rage and began hitting the wall cereal . " Our little rascal , " laughed Mr. Dursley
         as he left . He got into the car , and slowly backed away from the house number 4
      </p>
      
      
      <p>On a street corner you first noticed something strange - a cat that read the map .
         In the
         first time did not realize what they saw - sharply turned his head to look again .
         At
         the corner of Privet Drive stood tabby cat, but no trace around the map . What he
         's
         ever occurred to um ? It must have been an optical illusion . Mr. Dursley blinked
         and
         stared at the cat . She stared at him . When branched towards his head, looked into
         the
         mirror. Cat you just read table named their streets - not looked at it , the cats
         did
         not read , or maps , or inscriptions . Mr. Dursley shook his head and cat forgotten
         . As
         we approach the city , thought to have nothing but the big order , which would one
         day
         like to receive . but when going into town , drills drove out of his head again
         something else . As he stood in the usual morning traffic jam , he could not help
         but
         notice that the street walking strangely amount poobliekaných people . People in coats
         .
         Mr. Dursley hated poobliekaných crazy people - oh , those awful clothes in which today's
         young go ! It occurred to him that this again is not dajaký scored a fashion hit .
         Drummed her fingers over the steering wheel, and suddenly his eyes fell on the group
         very strange people close to him . Excitedly whispered something . Mr Dursley most
         outraged when he discovered that some of them are no longer the youngest , that one
         man
         , for example , is certainly older than him and wearing a emerald green cloak ! That
         is
         not ashamed ! But then Mr. Dursley occurred to that probably goes back on some nuts
         campaign - these people certainly collected money for something ... yes, it will .
         The
         column was moved and came in a few minutes Mr. Dursley to the parking lot and head
         of
         Vrtamex again had only themselves drills .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mr. Dursley sat in an office on the ninth floor always back to the window . if sitting
         face to the window , he would probably be in that day pretty big problems to focus
         only
         on drills . A as seen owls that flew in broad daylight around town , although people
         on
         the street saw them ; they hovered over their heads one by one , they pointed a finger
         at them and watching them with an open mouth . Mr. Dursley survived quite normal morning
         without owls. scolded five people . He recalled some important phone calls and again
         someone scolded . had a good noon mood and you said a little stirs the legs , goes
         to
         the bakery to across the street and buy something to eat .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Quite forgotten individuals in the bodies , but suddenly a bit before the bakery again
         missed the group very strange people . He walked past them , cast an evil eye on them
         .
         He did not know why, but it zneisťovali . When they returned back along with a large
         paper cone bag , he heard a snippet of their conversation . " The Potters , indeed,
         I
         heard it ... "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" ... Yes, their son , Harry ... "</p>
      
      
      <p>Mr. Dursley zdúpnel . Horror seized him . Looking back towards those people if they
         wanted to say something , but subsequently changed his mind .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He ran across the road, rushed to her office , the secretary shouted to him disturb
         ,
         grabbed the phone . Once tapped home phone number , changed his mind . Hang up ,
         stroking a beard and wondering ... no , the message is stupid . Potter did There is
         no
         unusual name . Potter is certainly many of them , even those that have a son Harry.
         And
         actually did not know whether his nephew was called Harry . In life this guy seen.
         Can
         be called Harvey . Or Harold . There is no reason to troubled Mrs. Dursley , at any
         mention of her sister was always very angry . Nor is it No wonder - if he had such
         a
         sister ... but still , those people in cloaks ...
      </p>
      
      
      <p> Afternoon already knew the drill so well focused , and at five o'clock when based
         on
         building was so worried that crashed into Mr stationary at the entrance .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Excuse me , " grumbled when the old, poor man lost his balance and almost fell .
         Soon
         Mr Dursley noticed that the man is wearing a purple cloak . Absolutely not mind that
         somebody almost toppled to the ground . On the contrary, his face appeared širokánsky
         smile and squeaky voice , in which passers wonderingly obzerali , said : " You do
         not
         have apologize , my dear , today I did not solve the rate ! Rejoice , You-Know - Who
         finally passed ! Even Muggles like you should enjoy in this happy , overjoyed day!
         "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The old man hugged Mr. Dursley and walked away .</p>
      
      
      <p>Mr. Dursley stood as transfixed . Embraced him quite a stranger . And I think he called
         Muggle , whatever that means anything . He was terrified of it . Hurriedly walked
         to the
         car and way home you insinuate that everything was probably just a figment of his
         imagination , which however, would never admit so far , because imagination itself
         never
         acknowledge .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When he turned on the access path to the house No. 4 , the first thing he saw - and
         he
         truly mood not improved - was a cat that noticed in the morning . Now she was sitting
         on
         a garden parapet . was 'm sure it's her , had exactly the same speckles around the
         eyes
         .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Shoo ! " Chased after her , Mr Dursley .</p>
      
      
      <p>The cat did not move . Just looked at him closely . Is this normal? Mr. Dursley wondered
         . While recovering , and then went into the house . Was still firmly resolved that
         his
         wife alludes not .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mrs. Dursley lived a pretty nice , normal day . At dinner, talked about man the problems
         that Ms from neighbors with her daughter , also that Dudley had learned a new word
         ( "
         Do " ) . Mr. Dursley he tried to behave normally. When Mrs. Dursley impose Dudley's
         sleep , went into the living room and caught the last message the evening TV newspaper
         :
         " Birdwatchers from across the country have reported to us that owls are now behaving
         most unusual . Although normally hunt at night and during the day they almost can
         not
         see , these birds was now seen from the east to the innumerable places like flying
         all
         directions . Scientists can not explain why the owls suddenly changed his life rhythm
         .
         " Moderator smiled . " The real mystery . And now I put the word Jim McGuffin and
         weather reports . Tonight we count on other Owl shower, Jim ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p> " Well , " began the second presenter , ' about it , although I know nothing , but
         only
         owls are now behaving strangely . Viewers from distant counties , such as Kent ,
         Yorkshire and Dundee , we phone calls , instead of rain , which I predicted yesterday
         ,
         supposedly experienced showers shooting stars ! People seem to ask bonfires started
         a
         little earlier - 31 October will be up to week , dear viewers , you have to wait a
         while
         longer ! But tonight I promise you really wet night . "Mr. Dursley sat in the chair
         as
         adhering . Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by day ? Mysterious people
         in
         cloaks all over town ? A whispering , whispering about The Potters ...
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mrs. Dursley walked into the living room with two cups of tea . Nothing can be done
         .
         Will her have to say . Nervously cleared his throat . "Er - Petunia , dear - you have
         not heard the last time about his sister ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It happened exactly as expected , Mrs. Dursley was horrified and outraged threw him
         view
         . No wonder, since usually the face that does not have any sister .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" No, " she said . " Why ? "</p>
      
      
      <p>"For the reports mentioned the very strange things , " Mr. Dursley mumbled . " Owls
         falling ... stars ... and today the city has been a lot of funny -looking people ...
         " "
         So? " vybrechla Mrs. Dursley .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Well , I just ... that ... maybe it has something to do with ... but you know ...
         those
         of its cronies . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips . Mr. Dursley wondered whether it
         is
         reasonable to mention her and that he heard the name " Potter " . He decided to not
         .
         Instead, he asked , just to make conversation : "That their son - in can be as Dudley's
         age , is not it? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" I think so , " replied Mrs. Dursley very shortly .</p>
      
      
      <p>"What is his real name ? Howard or so . "</p>
      
      
      <p>" Harry . Appalling dozen name , to be honest . "</p>
      
      
      <p>"Exactly , " said Mr. Dursley , and his mood dropped below freezing . "Totally with
         you
         Agree . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p> They went upstairs to the bedroom and on to the topic in more returned. When Mrs
         Dursley
         in bathroom , Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered into the front yards
         .
         cat there still sat . Stared intently at the lower end of Privet Drive , as if waiting
         for something . 
      </p>
      
      
      <p> Could he just frustrate ? You really can have it all to do with the Potters ? if
         yes ...
         if it transpires that their relatives - about to flip .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Dursleys lie down to sleep . Mrs. Dursley fell asleep immediately , Mr. Dursley
         lay
         with open eyes and over again it assumes the whole head. Just before he fell asleep
         ,
         have facilitated breathed because it occurred to that, as well as the Potters have
         fingers, it does not mean that they must find themselves close to either his or Madam
         Dursleys . Potters know very well what he and Petunia thought about such as they ...
         do
         not see why they would not , what is going on , it somehow hit - and yawned turned
         on
         its side - they truly do not have to worry ...
      </p>
      
      
      <p>How much is just wrong.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mr. Dursley Although plunged into troubled sleep , but the cat did not appear on the
         parapet smallest signs of fatigue . She sat motionless as a statue and deprived eyes
         on
         the distal end of Privet roads . When the side street Buchli car door , not moving
         , not
         even budge when its just above his head flew two owls . And when you finally changed
         position was almost midnight .
      </p>
      
      
      <p> The corner , to which she looked , suddenly emerged a man, so suddenly and silently
         , as
         if grown from the ground . Sible cat tail and eyes narrowed .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The man on Privet Drive had never been seen . He was tall, thin and very old , judging
         by
         his silver hair and beard , which were also back long to get them still could tuck
         in
         the waistband. He was wearing long robes , a purple mantle edge rubbed on the ground
         ,
         and boots with buckle high-heeled . For slides shaped glasses Crescent him glowed
         bright
         blue eyes , nose had such a long and curved like him in previously broken at least
         twice
         . The man 's name was Albus Dumbledore .
      </p>
      
      
      <p> Albus Dumbledore apparently knew that he came to the street , where everything connected
         with it , starting with his name and ending with boots was unwelcome . They devoted
         themselves to wade in internal jacket pockets as if looking for something . However,
         he
         noticed that he was being observed , because suddenly suddenly looked up and looked
         at
         the cat that stared at him from the opposite end street . That look he clearly amused
         .
         He grinned and muttered , "I might have guessed . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Finally, in the inner pocket found what he was looking . It looked like a silver
         cigarette lighter . He opened it and held ahead and stucco. The nearest lamp light
         shivered and went out . Stuka again - the next lamp flickered and plunged into darkness
         . twelve Stuka zhasínačom , only to flashing lights on across the street there were
         only
         two small dots in distance - cats eyes that watched him . If at that time someone
         looked
         out the window , perhaps even Mrs. Dursley with its X-ray view , nothing of what was
         going on down on the sidewalk , would not see anything . Dumbledore hid zhasínač back
         into the housing , stepped towards the house number 4 and then sit down on the parapet
         cat . Without it for even a looked after while he spoke .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" I'm here you did not expect , Professor McGonagall . "</p>
      
      
      <p>He turned with a smile to the striped cat , that has already been . He smiled very
         strict
         looking lady in glasses with a rectangular frame that had the same shape and size
         as
         speckles , which had previously cat around the eyes . Although she was clad in a cloak
         ,
         emerald . Black hair was off to a solid bun . She looked exasperated .
      </p>
      
      
      <p> " How did you know it was me ? "</p>
      
      
      <p>" My dear Professor , in my life seen a cat that would be sitting so stiffly . "</p>
      
      
      <p>" And you would have sat stiffly , if you are stuck on low walls all day , " said
         Professor McGonagall . "You sit here all day ? When you celebrate ? On the way here
         I
         passed several dozen different parties and celebrations . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Professor McGonagall sighed angrily .</p>
      
      
      <p>" Yes, yes , everyone is celebrating , you're right , " she said impatiently . " You
         would think that be careful , but no - even the Muggles have noticed that something
         was
         wrong . They talked about the news. " She nodded toward the Dursleys' dark living
         room
         window . " I heard that. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars ... not completely stupid
         .
         They could not get it yet noticing . Shooting stars in Kent - I'll give it to the
         neck ,
         it was a Dedalus Diggle . He never has no brain . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" You can not be angry at them , " said Dumbledore pleasantly . " For the last eleven
         years had many reasons to celebrate . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p> " I know , " said Professor McGonagall irritably . " But that does not mean that
         they
         have completely lose his head . Behave carelessly explicitly , walk the streets in
         broad
         daylight , even no muggle clothes , and go vats , gossip . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>She threw a sharp look at Dumbledore , hoping to say something , but did not happen
         , so
         continued . " It would be really sad if we Muggles have revealed the very day when
         You-Know - Who disappeared forever . Really , Dumbledore , you think you really after
         ?
         "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" It seems so , " said Dumbledore . "We have to be really grateful for that . Would
         you
         like a lemon drops ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" What if I give you ? "</p>
      
      
      <p>" Lemon drops. This muggle sweetness almost adore . "</p>
      
      
      <p>"No thank you , " said Professor McGonagall curtly , as if to suggest that now really
         not
         a good time for lemon drops . " As I mentioned before, if the You-Know - Who disappeared
         ... "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" My dear professor , such a sensible person like you would be calling him by name
         . the
         whole nonsense with You-Know - Before - eleven years I try to convince people that
         called him his proper name : Voldemort . " Professor McGonagall flinched , but
         Dumbledore , who just peel off from each other , two lemon drops , pretend you did
         not
         notice . "If about it We will continue to speak of You-Know - Kom , it all gets messes
         .
         I see no reason Why should we be afraid to pronounce Voldemort's name . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"You're right , " said Professor McGonagall half indignant , half admiringly . " But
         you're different. Everyone knows that you are the only one of whom was You-Know -
         Who ,
         all right then, Voldemort fears . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p> " You flatter me , " said Dumbledore happily . " Voldemort has the ability , as I
         have
         never I will not . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" But just because you're too - as I - too noble to have their were used . "</p>
      
      
      <p> " Even the darkness . Last time I was so red, when Madam Pomfrey told me that she
         likes
         my new earmuffs . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Professor McGonagall cast a stern look at Dumbledore and said, " The owls are nothing
         Compared with speeches, which are circulating . You know what they say ? Why go? What
         he
         said finally, stopped ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It seemed that Professor McGonagall came to the topic about which the Board discussed
         and
         which was why celučičký day presedela the cold , hard parapet because no woman and
         no
         cat would not be able to look at someone in such a piercing look , What right now
         she
         denied Dumbledore . It was clear that no matter who tells you he wants you wants not
         believe it until Dumbledore confirmed that this is true . Dumbledore However selects
         the
         next lemon candy and did not answer .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" They say , " she insisted , " that last night Voldemort appeared in Godric 's Hollow
         .
         Apparently came for the Potters . It is said that Lily and James Potters are - are
         -
         that they are dead . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore nodded . Professor McGonagall gasped .</p>
      
      
      <p>" Lily and James ... I can not believe ... I did not want to believe it ... Oh , Albus
         ... "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder . " I know ... I know ... "
         he said
         dejectedly .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Professor McGonagall trembling voice continued . " And that's not all . apparently
         wanted
         kill their son Harry . Well - failed him. Failed to kill small boy . No one knows
         why or
         how it happened , but said if he did not kill Harry Potter , its power suddenly passed
         -
         and therefore disappeared . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore nodded sadly .</p>
      
      
      <p>" Is - is this true ? " She asked, voice trembling McGonagall . "After everything
         done
         ... so many people who could destroy him ... kill a little boy ? Unbelievable ...
         I
         stopped him just that ... but how is it possible that Harry survive ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" We are left nothing but a guess , " said Dumbledore . " It will probably never know.
         "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and attach it alternately once
         the
         one , once the second eye glasses below . Dumbledore took a deep sigh , picked out
         of
         pocket gold watch and looked at them , they were very odd watch. Had twelve wise and
         no
         numbers along the edge of a small planet circulated . It had to have some sense because
         Dumbledore them after a while, tucked back into his pocket , saying, " Hagrid's late.
         from him you know I'm here , right? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Yes , " replied Professor McGonagall . " But obviously you do not divulge why you
         among
         all the cities chosen just this ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Because we want to deliver Harry to his aunt and uncle . They are his only relatives
         .
         "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" I guess just - I guess you really want to say to those people who live here ? "
         Horrified the Professor McGonagall , jumping to flat feet and pointing at number 4
         "
         Dumbledore - you can not ! I've watched them all day . The world will not find two
         people that they would be we differed more than these here . And that their son -
         I was
         a witness , as he went with his mother Up and down this street all the time it kicked
         and yelled that he wants a treat . And here is live Harry Potter ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Here it will be the best , " said Dumbledore . "When he's older , his uncle and his
         aunt
         explain everything . I wrote them a letter . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" List? " Professor McGonagall did not believe my ears and horrified again sat on
         the
         parapet . " And you think Dumbledore really think that all of this can be explained
         by
         one letter ? These people will never understand him ! Be famous - becomes a legend
         ,
         nečudovala I would , if today went into history as the Day of Harry Potter - Harry
         will
         be write books - his name will know every little child in our world ! "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Exactly , " Dumbledore nodded and looked very seriously over the semi-lunar glasses
         his
         glasses . " That would muddled head every guy . He became famous before able to walk
         and
         talk ! He became famous for something you will not even remember ! Note that while
         it
         understands him will really better when it grow somewhere past . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth , but then she changed her mind , and she swallowed
         idle After a moment she said, " Hey - hey , you're right , of course . But how is
         this
         kid here gets, Dumbledore ? " Suddenly she looked at his jacket , as if she thought
         that
         it conceals below it .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Hagrid bring it . "</p>
      
      
      <p>" You think it - wise - to entrust Hagrid's such an important thing ? "</p>
      
      
      <p>" Hagrid would I have given my life for , " said Dumbledore .</p>
      
      
      <p>" I'm not saying no heart in the right place , " said Professor McGonagall with
         grudgingly , " but you must admit that it is not very reliable. Is known about him
         ,
         that he sometimes a little - what was it ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The silence around them cross the rumbling away . Gradually got louder and they looked
         alternately at lower and upper end of the street when the light appears ; rumble erupted
         in crashes and they looked up to the sky - the air from the top of a huge motorcycle
         fell and landed straight on the road before them .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This bike was huge , but it still was nothing compared to the guy who sat on it .
         Was
         twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide . In short , the too
         big
         to be real , and he really wildly - most of his face mask tufts of long messy black
         hair
         and beard , had as palm tops of garbage baskets and his legs looked in leather
         bagančiach as dolphin pups. The gigantic He was holding a bundle wrapped in a blanket
         .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Hagrid , " Dumbledore spoke to him , his voice was felt relief. "Finally you're
         here.
         Where you got hold of that bike ? "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" I Žičal it , Professor Dumbledore ," said branch and carefully climbed off the bike
         . "
         From Young Sirius Black . Here, sir . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" You should not have any problems? "</p>
      
      
      <p>" No, sir - house was almost to dust, but I got him out before there swarmed Muggles
         .
         When we Ficalho of Bristol , fell asleep . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall leaned over the bundle in a blanket . Saw the
         boy ,
         which rigidly asleep. At the head under the black stic saw strangely curved scar
         flash.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" That's where he ... ? " Whispered Professor McGonagall .</p>
      
      
      <p>" Yes , " replied Dumbledore . " That he has a scar forever . "</p>
      
      
      <p>" Could not we do something about it , Dumbledore ? "</p>
      
      
      <p>" Even if I could do that. Scars can come in handy . I also got one above the left
         knee ,
         which looks exactly like a map of the London Underground . Well - give it to me ,
         Hagrid
         - let's have the first row. "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and headed for the house Dursleys .</p>
      
      
      <p>" Could - could I say goodbye to him , sir ? " Asked Hagrid . He bent his enormous
         hairy
         head over Harry and he delivered a prickly - tingling kiss . Then out of the blue
         from
         himself nothing gave grunts , like the wail of a wounded dog.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Pssst ! " Hissed Professor McGonagall , " wake Muggles ! "</p>
      
      
      <p>" Pp - sorry , " sobbed Hagrid , pulling a huge , spotted handkerchief and burying
         it in
         face . " I can not stand it , Lily and James are dead - and úbožiačik Harry must live
         with Muggles ... "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Yes, yes , it's very sad , but you need to recover Hagrid because we giveaway "
         whispered Professor McGonagall and Hagrid timidly stroked yet at hand . Dumbledore
         Meanwhile exceeded the low parapet garden and walked to the front door . He put Harry
         caution on stairs , selected from leaf sheath , Harry slipped it under the covers
         and
         returned . whole minute there these three stood staring at the small nodule . Hagrid's
         shoulders shook , Professor McGonagall ODUS žmurkala a glimmer in Dumbledore's eyes
         that
         they ever shone so brightly , is somewhere along .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Well , " Dumbledore finally spoke , " and it is . Already here we have to do . We
         can
         add to others and celebrate . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Well , " Hagrid muttered softly , " I'm going to return the bike Sirius Black .
         Brú
         night , Mrs. Professor McGonagall - Professor Dumbledore . "
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Hagrid wiped streams of tears into the sleeve , jumped on the bike and kick the engine
         .
         S deafening bang was raised in height and disappeared in the dark . 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Goodbye, Professor McGonagall , " said Dumbledore pokyvujúc head. teacher McGonagall
         ,
         rather than responding to zatrúbila handkerchiefs .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore turned around and walked down the street . At the corner he stopped and
         picked
         zhasínač . once Stuka and twelve balls of light flew back to their street lamps ,
         Privet
         Drive reflection was flooded with orange light and he saw a cat like disappearing
         around
         the corner at the opposite end of the street . One last look towards the bundle in
         a
         blanket on the steps before the number 4
      </p>
      
      
      <p>" Good luck , Harry , " he murmured . He turned heel , rustled jacket and not him
         .
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Breeze rippled leaves neatly spliced hedges on Privet Drive , which lay stealthily
         and
         orderly under atramentovočiernou sky and was the last place from you would expect
         that
         there are mysterious things happen . Harry Potter in a blanket pomrvil , but did not
         wake up. Its small handle gripped sheet and further he slept , unaware that it is
         exceptional , it is famous that in a few hours it wakes Mrs. Dursley's scream , which
         opens the door, delivering the out empty bottles of milk , the next few weeks it will
         be
         his cousin Dudley constantly jostle and tweaking ... could not have imagined that
         Right
         at that moment throughout the country secretly meet people lift their bowls and silent
         voice whispering : " To Harry Potter - the boy who lived ! "
