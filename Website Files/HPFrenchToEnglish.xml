            <s tr="0">Mrs. Dursley , meanwhile, was thin and blonde and had a <dif id="3" pos="n" type="mst">stroke</dif> two times longer
                than the average, which was very useful to <dif id="4" pos="pro" type="gen">him</dif> to spy on <dif id="5" pos="pro" type="gen">his</dif> neighbors.</s>
            <s tr="0">The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion <dif id="6" pos="pro" type="gen">it</dif> was the most

            <s tr="0">The Dursleys had everything they wanted.</s>
            <s tr="0">The only undesirable thing they had, it was a shameful secret.</s>
            <s tr="1">If anyone were to ever hear about Potter , they were convinced they <dif id="7" pos="pp" type="mst">just do not

                Mrs. Potter.</s>
            <s tr="0">In fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended that she was an only child , because her sister
                and her good for nothing husband were as far away as possible from what was a
                Dursley .</s>
            <s tr="0">The Dursleys trembled with fear at the thought of what <ins>would</ins> the neighbors

            <s tr="0">They knew that Potter , too, had a little boy , but they had never seen.</s>
            <s tr="1">Its existence constituted an additional reason to keep Potter away : there was

        </p>
        <p>
            <s tr="0">It was in the corner he noticed for the first time an unusual detail : a cat

                wore capes .</s>
            <s tr="1">Mr. Dursley could not bear people - young had shifted some of these

            <s tr="0">This afternoon , he found it much more difficult to concentrate on these drills
