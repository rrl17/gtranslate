      <p>
         <span class="s">Mr. and Mrs. Dursley at 4 Privet Drive were proud to be entirely normal,
            very proud even . </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>No one would have thought that they could get caught up in a
            strange and mysterious story, because with such nonsense they wanted to have nothing to
            do . </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley was the director of a company called Grunnings that
            manufactured drills. </span>
         <span class="s">He was tall and stocky and had almost no neck , <span class="dif"
               >but</span> a very large mustache. </span>
         <span class="s">Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had twice as much neck as might have
            been necessary , but this was very useful because <span class="dif">they</span> could
            stretch <span class="dif">their</span>
            <span class="dif">necks</span> over the fence and <span class="dif">peeking</span> over
               <span class="dif">to</span> the neighbors .</span>
         <span class="s">The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their eyes there was
            nowhere a more splendid boy. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="s">The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but they also had a secret , and
            that someone could discover <span class="dif"></span>, was <span class="dif">her</span>
            biggest worry. </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Simply unbearable , if the thing would come out with the
            Potters would be . </span>
         <span class="s">Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley 's sister , but the two had not seen each
            other for many years. </span>
         <span class="s">Mrs. Dursley even claimed that she had no sister , because <span
               class="dif">they</span> and <span class="dif">their</span> no-good of a man were
               <span class="dif">so</span>
            <span class="dif">undursleyhaft</span> , as could be imagined . </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>The Dursleys shuddered at the thought of what the neighbors
            would say , the Potters one day should show up in their street . </span>
         <span class="s">The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, but they had never seen
               <span class="dif"></span> before. </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Also, this boy was a good reason to stay away from the Potters
            , with such a child you should not come into contact Dudley . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley on the dim and gray Tuesday, when
            our story begins , <span class="dif">the eyes</span>
            <span class="dif">pitched</span> at the cloudy sky outside no sign of the strange and
            mysterious things could be seen , which should happen in the country soon everywhere. </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Mr. Dursley hummed and looked for work his most boring tie ,
            and Mrs. Dursley gossiped cheerfully <span class="dif">to herself</span> as she jockeyed
            with <span class="dif">the</span> screaming Dudley and squeezed him <span class="dif"
               >in</span> his high chair. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="s">None of them saw the huge tawny owl <span class="dif">flying</span> past
            the window. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>At half past eight <span class="dif">attacked</span> Mr.
            Dursley <span class="dif">after</span>
            <span class="dif">the</span> briefcase , gave his wife a peck on the cheek and tried it
               <span class="dif">at</span> Dudley with a farewell kiss. </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>However, <span class="dif">the</span> went wrong because
            Dudley just had a tantrum and threw <span class="dif"></span>the walls <span class="dif"
               >with</span> his porridge. </span>
         <span class="s">" Little Rascal ," chortled Mr. Dursley as he went outside.</span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>He sat in the car and drove back <span class="dif"></span>the
               <span class="dif">entrance</span>
            <span class="dif">to</span> number 4 <span class="dif">also</span> . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>At the street corner, he noticed for the first time something
            strange - a cat who studied a map . </span>
         <span class="s">For a moment Mr. Dursley was not clear what he had seen - then he turned
            quickly <span class="dif">to head back</span> to look again. </span>
         <span class="s">At the <span class="dif">inflection</span> to Privet Drive was a tabby cat,
            but a road map could not be seen . </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>What he had just thought <span class="dif">again</span> ! </span>
         <span class="s">That must have been a hallucination .</span>
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.</span>
         <span class="s">The cat stared back.</span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>While Mr. Dursley came around the corner and down the street
            drove , he watched the cat in his rearview mirror . </span>
         <span class="s">Now <span class="dif">they</span>
            <span class="dif">read</span> the sign with the name of Privet Drive - no, she <span
               class="dif">looked</span> at the sign. </span>
         <span class="s">Cats could not read maps or signs.</span>
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and <span class="dif">chased</span>
            the cat out of his mind. </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>As he drove toward town he had only the big order <span
               class="dif">for</span> drills in the <span class="dif">sense</span> that would arrive
            today hopefully . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>But in the suburbs the drills were <span class="dif"
               >replaced</span> by something else out of his thoughts . </span>
         <span class="s">He was stuck in the usual morning traffic jam and could not help but notice
            that apparently a lot of strangely dressed people were traveling . </span>
         <span class="s">People in long and wide cloaks .</span>
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley could not bear people who <span class="dif">engaged</span>
            weird - like the young people <span class="dif">were cleaning out</span> ! </span>
         <span class="s">That probably had to be some stupid new fashion.</span>
         <span class="s">He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on an <span
               class="dif">accumulation</span> of these strange figures not far from him . </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Excitedly, they whispered to each other . </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Enraged <span class="dif">presented</span> Mr. Dursley that
            some of them were not young; <span class="dif">nanu</span> , that man there had to be
            older than he was and <span class="dif">wore</span> an emerald green cloak ! </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>
            <span class="dif"></span>Perhaps had nerve ! </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>But then Mr. Dursley <span class="dif">fell</span> suddenly
            that this had to be a crazy <span class="dif">fairing well</span> - the people gathered
            apparently for something ... </span>
         <span class="s">yes , <span class="dif">it</span> had to be <span class="dif"></span>. </span>
         <span class="s">The line of cars moved, and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley drove into the
            parking lot of his company , his thoughts again <span class="dif">in</span> the drills .
         </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>In his office on the ninth floor Mr. Dursley always sat with
            his back to the window. </span>
         <span class="s">Otherwise it would <span class="dif">be</span> difficult for him <span
               class="dif">this</span> morning, to focus on the drills . </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>He did not notice the owls , past the shot in broad daylight ,
               <span class="dif">but rather</span> the people down in the street, they pointed to
            the skies and watched with open mouths looking like an owl flew away after another over
            their heads . </span>
         <span class="s">Most of them had ever never seen one , not even at night.</span>
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley , however, <span class="dif">spent</span> a very ordinary , owl
            -free morning. </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>He <span class="dif">made</span> five different people to
            screw. </span>
         <span class="s">He <span class="dif">led</span> several important telephone calls ,
            screaming a little louder. </span>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>By lunchtime he was brilliant mood and now wanted a little
            stretch their legs and get a donut at the bakery across the street. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>The people in the strange appearance he had long forgotten ,
            but now , on the way to the bakery , he met some of these figures . </span>
         <span class="s">In passing, he gave them angry looks.</span>
         <span class="s">He did not know why, but <span class="dif">she</span> caused him
            discomfort. </span>
         <span class="s">Also this <span class="dif">pack</span> here whispering excitedly and a
            collection box was nowhere to be seen . </span>
         <span class="s">On the way back from the bakery , a bag with a large donut in his hand, he
               <span class="dif">grabbed</span> a few words from them. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"The Potters , that's right , I've heard -
            "</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" - Yes , their son , Harry - "</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Fear came over him .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He turned around at the whisperers as if he
            wanted to tell them something, but then thought better of it . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He quickly crossed the street , rushed up to
            the office, snapped at his secretary , he did not want to be disturbed, grabbed the
            phone and had almost the number of selected home when he changed his mind . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He put the phone down and stroked his
            mustache.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">No, he thought , I 'm stupid .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Potter was not a particularly unusual name
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Sure there were a lot of people who were called
            Potter and had a son named Harry. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Now that he thought about it, he was not even
            sure his nephew was called Harry really . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He had not even seen the boy .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He could also be called Harvey.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Or Harold .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley,
            they got ever so upset if you even mentioned her sister. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He made her so no accusation - if he had such a
            sister ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">And yet , these people in cloaks ...</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">That afternoon, he found it a lot harder to
            keep his mind on the drill , and when he left the office at five clock , he was still so
            full of sorrow that it is equal collided with the first step out with someone. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Sorry," he grumbled , as the little old man
            came to stumble and almost fell . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Only after a few seconds remarked Mr. Dursley
            that the man was wearing a violet cloak. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">That he had almost knocked him did not seem to
            annoy him further .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">On the contrary, on his face opened up a big
            smile , and the people who walked past , looked up when he said in a squeaky voice: "
            Today I forgive all , my dear Lord, today I can not derail ! </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Let us rejoice , for You -Know -Who has gone at
            last from us!</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Even Muggles like you should celebrate this
            joyful , joyful day!</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around in
            belly height and departed thence . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A complete stranger had hugged him.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Also, he had probably been called a Muggle ,
            whatever might be the one.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Totally messed up he hurried to his car and
            drove home.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He hoped these things only to fancy , and that
            was new for him because of imagination he usually kept nothing. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">As he turned into the driveway of number four ,
            as his glance fell first - and did nothing to improve his mood - on the tabby cat he 'd
            seen in the morning. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She was now sitting on his garden wall.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Certainly it was the same cat , and she had the
            same pattern around the eyes. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Shhh !</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Mr. Dursley hissed loudly.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The cat did not move.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She looked at him from serious eyes .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Was such a thing as normal for cats, Mr.
            Dursley wondered .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He tried to pull herself together and opened
            the front door.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Still, he was determined to say nothing of all
            this his wife.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mrs. Dursley had a nice , ordinary day
            behind.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">At dinner she told him all about Woman
            Nachbarins problems with their daughter and that Dudley had learned a new word (" Pooh
            "). </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Dursley tried quite as always to
            give.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">After Dudley had been put to bed , he went into
            the living room , where he watched the latest news on the evening news . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" And here's another message.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">As the bird watchers across the country report
            , our owls have behaved very unusually today. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Although owls normally hunt at night and during
            the day hardly be seen , these birds have been observed since sunrise hundreds of times
            , as they had flown back and forth across the country. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Experts can not explain why the owls have
            suddenly changed their habits . « The newscaster allowed himself a grin. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Very mysterious.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">And now to Jim McGuffin with the
            weather.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Are owls more today evening showers expected ,
            Jim?"</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Well, Ted ," said the weatherman , " said I
            can not say, but it's not only the owls that have now behaving strangely . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Spectators from as far away areas such as Kent
            , Yorkshire and Dundee have called me today and reported that all showers are descended
            from shooting stars instead of the rain I promised yesterday! </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Maybe people have celebrated too early New
            Year's Eve - that's still a while to go , ladies and gentlemen ! </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">But I can promise a wet night for
            today."</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Dursley sat stiff as an icicle in his
            chair.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Shooting stars all over Britain?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Owls that flew in the day ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Everywhere mysterious people in weird
            clothes?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">And a whisper , a whisper about the Potters
            ...</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mrs. Dursley came into the living room with two
            cups of tea .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It was no use .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He had to tell her something .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He nervously cleared his throat.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Uh - Petunia , dear - you have not heard
            lately from your sister , or "?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">As he had feared , Mrs. Dursley looked at him ,
            horrified and angry.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Finally, they did so usually , as if she had no
            sister .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"No," she said sharply .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Why ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">» Funny stuff in the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Owls ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">shooting stars ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">and today were a lot of funny -looking people
            in town ...</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"And ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Snapped Mrs. Dursley .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Well, I just thought ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">maybe ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">it has something to do with ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">you know ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">her coterie .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea with pursed lips
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Could he dare to tell her that he had heard the
            name " Potter "?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">No, he could not.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Instead, he remarked as casually as he could ,
            " Their son - he would be about Dudley's age in , or "? </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I suppose ," Mrs. Dursley stiffly .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"What was his name again ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Howard , is not it ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">» Harry.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">An ugly , common name , if you ask me .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Oh yes," said Mr. Dursley , and the heart
            slipped into his pants.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Yes , I agree with you .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Until it was time to sleep and they went
            upstairs , he lost not a word about it . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr.
            Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The cat was still there.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She stared at Privet Drive as though it was
            waiting for something .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Was it his imagination everything one only
            ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Could all this have anything to do with the
            Potters ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">If it was so ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">and when came out that they were related to a
            pair of - no, he would simply can not bear . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The Dursleys went to bed.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly one , but Mr.
            Dursley lay awake and rolled it all over again in my head back and forth. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Before he fell asleep , it was a last ,
            comforting thought .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Even if the Potters had really to do with this
            story, there was no reason why they should show up at him and Mrs. Dursley . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia
            from them and their kind thought ... </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He could not think how he and Petunia should
            get into anything out there was going on - he yawned and turned over on his side - so
            would he and his wife have certainly nothing to do ... </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">How much he was mistaken .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Dursley might have hinübergeglitten into an
            uneasy sleep, but the cat outside on the wall showed no sign of fatigue. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She sat still as a statue , his eyes unblinking
            , focused on the more remote corner of Privet Drive . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">No hairs stirred when a road was further
            slammed a car door or as two owls away buzzed over her head. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In fact, it was almost midnight when the cat
            was stirring for the first time . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">At the corner , they had observed a man
            appeared so suddenly and silently , as if he had grown straight from the ground. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed
            to slits.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A man like this had never been seen in Privet
            Drive .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He was tall, thin and very old , or at least
            close to the silver color of his hair and beard after , both were so long that they
            could have stuck in his belt. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He wore a long robe , a purple cloak that
            touched the ground, and buckle boots with high heels. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">His blue eyes shone sparkling behind half-moon
            spectacles out , and his nose was very long and crooked, as if it had broken at least
            twice. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Albus Dumbledore did not seem to notice that he
            had just appeared in a street where everything was welcome to him , from his name to his
            boots , by no means . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Lost in thought, he rummaged through the
            pockets of his cloak .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">But apparently he noticed that he was being
            watched , because he suddenly looked over to the cat , which was still staring at him
            from the other end of the street. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">For some reason, the cat's sight seemed to
            amuse him .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He chuckled and muttered, " I should have known
            ."</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In his pocket he had found what he was looking
            for.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It looked like a silver cigarette
            lighter.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He flipped open the lid , held it high in the
            air and let it snap .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">With a soft " plop " a street lamp went out in
            the vicinity.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He turned again - and the next lantern
            flickered and went out.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Twelve times he switched to the Ausmacher until
            the only lights that could be seen all over the road yet , two little pinheads in the
            distance were , and that was the cat , who was watching him the eyes. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">No one who would now looked out the window ,
            not even the keen-eyed Mrs. Dursley, anything would have noticed by now what happened on
            the sidewalk below. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore left the Ausmacher slip into the
            robe pocket and made his way along the road to number four , where he sat down on the
            wall next to the cat. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He did not look at , but after a while he spoke
            to her .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"What a surprise to see you here , Professor
            McGonagall.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">With a smile, he turned to the side, but the
            tiger cat was gone.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In their place he smiled at a pretty serious
            -looking woman with glasses , the glasses were square as the pattern around the eyes of
            the cat. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She also wore a cloak , an emerald green
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Her black hair was tied back in a tight bun
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She looked quite confused.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"How did you know it was me ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" She asked .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit
            so stiffly.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"They would also be stiff if you'd been sitting
            all day on a brick wall," said Professor McGonagall. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" The whole day ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Where you have yet to celebrate ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I must have passed on the way to at least a
            dozen feasts and parties.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Angry Professor McGonagall snorted through the
            nose.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Oh, yes , the whole world is celebrating ,
            very nice ," she said impatiently. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"You'd think they could be a bit more careful ,
            but no - even the Muggles have noticed something 's going on. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">They took it in their messages.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" With a head jerking she pointed to the dark
            living room window of the Dursleys . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I've heard it .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Swarms of owls ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">shooting stars ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Well, they are not quite stupid again .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">You just had to notice anything .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Shooting stars down in Kent - I 'll bet that
            was Dedalus Diggle .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He was never particularly reasonable.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"You can not blame them ," said Dumbledore
            gently .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Eleven years we have had precious little to
            celebrate .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I know," said Professor McGonagall
            irritably.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"But that's no reason to lose your head
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">People are just careless when in broad daylight
            roam outside on the streets and give rumors for the best. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">At least they could attract Muggle
            things.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She turned to Dumbledore with a sharp eye , as
            she hoped he would tell her something . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">But he was silent and she continued : "That
            would be a pretty kettle of fish when calculated on the day that You-Know -Who finally
            disappears, the Muggle everything would find out about us. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I suppose he is really gone, Dumbledore
            ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"It certainly looks ," said Dumbledore .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"We have to be grateful for many things.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Would you like a shower candy ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"A what ?"</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" A lemon effervescent candy.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A sweet tooth muggle , which I 'm very
            sharp.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"No, thank you," Professor McGonagall said
            coldly , as if not now is the right moment for sherbet lemons . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Like I said , even if You-Know -Who is really
            gone - "</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"My dear Professor , a reasonable person as you
            can but it certainly name them ? </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The whole nonsense with 'You -Know -Who' - for
            eleven years I'm trying to get people to call him by his real name . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Voldemort , " Professor McGonagall flinched ,
            but Dumbledore , the two other sweets from the bag fished , it seemed to take no notice
            . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"It confused but only if we continually
            'You-Know -Who say' .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I've never seen why I should have fear to speak
            Voldemort's name.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I know well," Professor McGonagall said, half
            applied , half admiringly.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"But you're different .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">We all know that you are the only one You-Know
            ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">um, well, Voldemort feared .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"You flatter me ," said Dumbledore
            quietly.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Voldemort had powers I will never have
            .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Just because you - yes - are noble to use them
            ."</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Lucky that it is dark.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">So I am no longer turned red , since Madam
            Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall looked at Dumbledore
            sharply and said, " The owls are nothing compared to the rumors flying around . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Do you know what they all say ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Why is he gone ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">What has finally stopped him ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Apparently Professor McGonagall had reached the
            point beyond which they wanted to talk about the real reason why she had been waiting
            all day on a cold, hard wall , for neither as a cat nor as a woman she had Dumbledore
            with such a piercing gaze nailed as right now. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Whatever " all liked " say , obviously she did
            not believe it until she had heard it from the mouth of Dumbledore. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The however, took another shower lemon candy
            and said nothing.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">» What do they say ," urged them on, " is in
            fact that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric 's Hollow . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He was looking for the Potters.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">According to the rumor are Lily and James
            Potter - they are - dead "</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore slowly lowered his head .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall stopped breathing .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Lily and James ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I can not believe it ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I did not believe it ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Oh , Albus ...</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore reached out and patted her gently on
            the shoulders.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I know ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I know ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" he said in a husky voice.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall went on in a trembling
            voice: " That's not all .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It is said that he tried to kill Harry Potter's
            son .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">But - he could not.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He could not kill that little boy .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">No one knows why or how, but it is, as he could
            not kill Harry Potter , Voldemort's power fell in on itself - and that's why he is gone
            . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore nodded gloomily .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Is that - ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">True," stammered Professor McGonagall.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"After all the things he has done - after all
            the people he killed - he could not kill a little boy ? </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">This is just unbelievable ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">just that sets it to an end ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">but how in heaven's Harry could survive
            that?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"We can only guess ," said Dumbledore .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Maybe we 'll never know .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace
            handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath the glasses. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore pulled a golden clock from his
            pocket and gave a long sniff of itself. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It was a very curious clock .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She had twelve hands but no numbers ; instead,
            little planets turning in her lap . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore had in any case this clock to tell
            something, because he put it back in the bag and said, " Hagrid late. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">By the way, I suppose he told you that I would
            come here ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Yes," said Professor McGonagall.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"And I do not suppose you will tell me , why
            are you here of all places ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and
            uncle.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">They are the only ones in the family who are
            still left to him .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" You do not mean - you simply can not people
            think that stay here ," cried Professor McGonagall , jumping up and pointing at number 4
            " Dumbledore - you can not. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I've seen all day.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">You could not find two people who resemble us
            less.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">And they have this boy - I've seen how he
            tortured his mother all the way down the street and screaming for sweets . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter and live here ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"This is the best place for him," Dumbledore
            said firmly. » Uncle and aunt will be able to explain everything to him when he is
            older. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I have written them a letter .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"A letter?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Repeated Professor McGonagall with stifling
            voice and sat back down on the wall. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Really, Dumbledore , you think you can explain
            all this in a letter ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">These people will never understand him!</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He'll be famous - a legend - I would not be
            surprised if the current day is called in the future Harry Potter day - all the books
            you will write about Harry - every child in our world will know his name " </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Exactly," said Dumbledore , looking very
            seriously over the half-moons of his reading glasses. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"That would be enough to turn any boy's head
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Famous before he can walk and talk !</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Famous for something that he will not even
            remember !</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Do not you see how much better it would be for
            him when he grows up away from all that until he's ready to comprehend it ? </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall opened her mouth , changed
            her mind , swallowed, and said, "Yes - yes , you're right , of course. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">But as the boy comes here , Dumbledore ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Suddenly she looked at his cloak as she
            thought , maybe he was hiding little Harry among them . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Hagrid brings with him.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"You think it - wise Hagrid to entrust
            something as important "</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I would trust Hagrid my life ," said
            Dumbledore .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"I am not suggesting that his heart is not in
            the right place ," muttered Professor McGonagall , "but you can not do so , as if he
            would be particularly prudent. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He tends to - what was that ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A low hum had broken the silence around them
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Louder and louder it was , and they looked left
            and right down the road, if perhaps appeared a spotlight . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The noise rose to a roar , and as they both
            looked to the sky - as a huge motorcycle fell out of the sky and landed on the road in
            front of them . </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Even the motorcycle was huge, but nothing
            compared to the man sitting astride it. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It was almost twice as large as an ordinary man
            and at least five times as wide. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He looked absolutely forbidden thick , and so
            wild - hair and beard covered with long strands almost his whole face , he had hands the
            size of trash can lids, and plugged into the leather boots feet like Delphi babies. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In his expansive , muscular arms he was holding
            a bundle of linen cloth .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Hagrid ," said Dumbledore with relieved
            voice.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"At last .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">And where did you get this bike from?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Do borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sir,"
            said the giant , climbing carefully from his motorcycle. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Young Sirius Black has lent it to me.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I've got him , sir.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Do not trouble?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"No, sir - house was almost destroyed , but I
            got it just to get out before the Muggles came is buzzing . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He fell asleep as we were flying over
            Bristol.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent their
            heads over the sheet bundle.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Inside was , just to see just a little boy ,
            hardly more than a baby, sound asleep . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Under a tuft of jet-black hair on his forehead
            they could see a strange cut that looked like lightning. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Is that where - ?</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Whispered Professor McGonagall.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Yes," said Dumbledore.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" This scar will always be him.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Can not you do something about it , Dumbledore
            ?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Even if I could , I would not .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Scars can be quite useful .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I myself have one on top of the left knee and
            is a flawless plan of the London Underground . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Well - give it to me , Hagrid - we bring it
            better behind us.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned to
            the house of the Dursleys .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Could I ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">could I tell him good-bye , sir, " asked Hagrid
            .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He bent his great , shaggy head over Harry and
            gave him a certainly very scratchy , beard hairy kiss. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a
            wounded dog.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Shhh !</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">" Hissed Professor McGonagall , "you awaken
            even the Muggles on !</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">» Vv forgiveness ," sobbed Hagrid , pulling a
            large , spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"But I kk- just can not grasp - Lily and James
            dead - and the poor little Harry must now live with the Muggles - " </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Yes, yes , that's all very sad, but get a grip
            , Hagrid , or we will discover us," Professor McGonagall whispered , patting Hagrid
            gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the
            front door . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He gently laid Harry to the front door , took a
            letter out of his cloak , tucked it between Harry's sheets and then returned to the
            other two . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A full minute the three stood there and looked
            at the little bundle ; Hagrid's shoulders shook , Professor McGonagall blinked rapidly ,
            and the sparkling light that always seemed otherwise from Dumbledore's eyes was probably
            extinct. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Well," Dumbledore said finally, " that's it
            ...</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">We have nothing more to look for.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">We'd better disappear and go to parties.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">» Jaow " said Hagrid with very muffled voice, "
            I'll take best off that box . </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Night , Professor McGonagall - .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor Dumbledore , sir, "</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Hagrid wiped his face with the sleeve of his
            jacket , the dripping-wet eyes , jumped on the bike and stirred up the machine with a
            Fußkick to life ; thundering she rose into the air and disappeared into the night .
         </span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"We 'll meet again soon , I suspect , Professor
            McGonagall ," said Dumbledore , nodding to her. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">To answer Professor McGonagall blew her nose
            the nose.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore turned and walked away down the
            street.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">On the corner he stopped and took out the
            Ausmacher .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He turned once and twelve balls of light darted
            back to their street lamps.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">With a time of Privet Drive glowed orange, and
            he could see a small tiger cat , the dot at the other end of the street around the
            corner. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">On the doorstep of number 4 , he could just see
            the bundle of linen cloth .</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">"Good luck, Harry ," he murmured.</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He turned on his heel and off with a wave of
            his cloak , he was gone.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A breeze ruffled the carefully manicured hedges
            of Privet Drive , which lay silent and tidy under the ink -colored sky , and never would
            we have thought that something unheard could happen. </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In his bedsheets Harry Potter turned to the
            side , without waking up .</span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">His little fingers clung to the letter beside
            him and he slept on , not knowing he was special , not knowing he was famous , not
            knowing that in a few hours when Mrs. Dursley would open the front door , also observed
            around the milk bottles , a cry would wake him , and also not knowing that would make
            him torture and torment his cousin Dudley in the next few weeks ... </span>
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He could not know that at this very moment, all
            over the country held secret meetings , glasses were raised and muffled voices saying, "
            In Harry Potter - the boy who lived !" </span>
