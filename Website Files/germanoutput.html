         <span class="s">Mr. and Mrs. Dursley at 4 Privet Drive were proud to be entirely normal,
            very proud even .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>No one would have thought that they could get caught up in a strange and
            mysterious story, because with such nonsense they wanted to have nothing to do .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley was the director of a company called Grunnings that
            manufactured drills.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">He was tall and stocky and had almost no neck , 
            <span class="dif conj mst" id="n1">but</span> a very large mustache.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had twice as much neck as might have
            been necessary , but this was very useful because 
            <span class="dif pro per" id="n2">they</span> could stretch 
            <span class="dif pro per" id="n3">their</span>
            
            <span class="dif pro num" id="n4">necks</span> over the fence and 
            <span class="dif v asp" id="n5">peeking</span> over 
            <span class="dif pp mst" id="n6">to</span> the neighbors .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their eyes there was
            nowhere a more splendid boy.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but they also had a secret , and
            that someone could discover 
            <span class="dif pro del" id="n7"></span>, was 
            <span class="dif pro per" id="n8">her</span> biggest worry.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Simply unbearable , if the thing would come out with the Potters would be
            .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley 's sister , but the two had not seen each
            other for many years.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Mrs. Dursley even claimed that she had no sister , because 
            <span class="dif pro per" id="n9">they</span> and 
            <span class="dif pro per" id="n10">their</span> no-good of a man
            were 
            <span class="dif adv mst" id="n11">so</span>
            
            <span class="dif adj mst" id="n12">undursleyhaft</span> , as could be imagined .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>The Dursleys shuddered at the thought of what the neighbors would say , the
            Potters one day should show up in their street .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, but they had never
            seen 
            <span class="dif pro del" id="n13"></span> before.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Also, this boy was a good reason to stay away from the Potters , with such
            a child you should not come into contact Dudley .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley on the dim and gray Tuesday, when our story
            begins , 
            <span class="dif n pos" id="n14">the eyes</span>
            
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n15">pitched</span> at the cloudy sky outside no sign of the
            strange and mysterious things could be seen , which should happen in the country
            soon everywhere.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Mr. Dursley hummed and looked for work his most boring tie , and Mrs.
            Dursley gossiped cheerfully 
            <span class="dif pro mst" id="n16">to herself</span> as she jockeyed
            with 
            <span class="dif det mst" id="n17">the</span> screaming Dudley and squeezed him 
            <span class="dif pp mst" id="n18">in</span> his high chair.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">None of them saw the huge tawny owl 
            <span class="dif v asp" id="n19">flying</span>
            past the window.
         </span>

      <p>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>At half past eight 
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n20">attacked</span> Mr. Dursley 
            <span class="dif pp mst" id="n21">after</span> 
            <span class="dif det pos" id="n22">the</span> briefcase , gave his wife
            a peck on the cheek and tried it 
            <span class="dif pp mst" id="n23">at</span> Dudley with a farewell kiss.
         </span>

            <span class="ast">*</span>However, 
            <span class="dif det mst" id="n24">the</span> went wrong because Dudley just had a tantrum and threw

            <span class="dif pp mst" id="n26">with</span> his porridge.

         <span class="s">" Little Rascal ," chortled Mr. Dursley as he went outside.</span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>He sat in the car and drove back

      <p>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>At the street corner, he noticed for the first time something strange - a cat
            who studied a map .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">For a moment Mr. Dursley was not clear what he had seen - then he turned
            quickly 
            <span class="dif pp mst" id="n31">to head back</span> to look again.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">At the 
            <span class="dif n mst" id="n32">inflection</span> to Privet Drive was a tabby cat, but a road map could not be
            seen .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>What he had just thought

         </span>
         
         <span class="s">That must have been a hallucination .</span>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.</span>
         
         <span class="s">The cat stared back.</span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>While Mr. Dursley came around the corner and down the street drove , he watched
            the cat in his rearview mirror .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Now 
            <span class="dif pro per" id="n34">they</span> 
            <span class="dif v asp" id="n35">read</span> the sign with the name of Privet Drive - no, she 
            <span class="dif v asp" id="n36">looked</span> at the
            sign.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Cats could not read maps or signs.</span>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and 
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n37">chased</span> the cat out of his mind.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>As he drove toward town he had only the big order

      <p>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>But in the suburbs the drills were 
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n39">replaced</span> by something else out of his
            thoughts .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">He was stuck in the usual morning traffic jam and could not help but notice
            that apparently a lot of strangely dressed people were traveling .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">People in long and wide cloaks .</span>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley could not bear people who 
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n40">engaged</span> weird - like the young people
            
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n41">were cleaning out</span> !
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">That probably had to be some stupid new fashion.</span>
         
         <span class="s">He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on an
            
            <span class="dif n mst" id="n42">accumulation</span> of these strange figures not far from him .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Excitedly, they whispered to each other .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Enraged 
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n43">presented</span> Mr. Dursley that some of them were not young; 
            <span class="dif int mst" id="n44">nanu</span> , that man

         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>But then Mr. Dursley 
            <span class="dif v mst" id="n47">fell</span> suddenly that this had to be a crazy 
            <span class="dif n mst" id="n48">fairing well</span> -
            the people gathered apparently for something ...
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">yes , 
            <span class="dif pro mst" id="n49">it</span> had to be

         </span>
         
         <span class="s">The line of cars moved, and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley drove into the
            parking lot of his company , his thoughts again 
            <span class="dif pp mst" id="n51">in</span> the drills .
