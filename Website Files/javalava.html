            that they were perfectly normal , thank you for them.

         <span class="s">They did not have time to waste on nonsense .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley headed Grunnings , a company that manufactured drills.</span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>
            <span class="dif" id="n2">It</span> <span class="box" id="bn2">pos=pro dif=mst</span>was a tall burly man , who had virtually no neck , but on the other hand had
            a mustache nice size .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Mrs. Dursley , meanwhile, was thin and blonde and had a 
            <span class="dif" id="n3">stroke</span> two times longer
            than the average, which was very useful to 
            <span class="dif" id="n4">him</span> to spy on 
             <span class="dif" id="n5">his</span><span class="box" id="bn5">pos=pro dif=mst</span> neighbors.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion 
            <span class="dif" id="n6">it</span> was the most
            beautiful child in the world .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">The Dursleys had everything they wanted.</span>
         
         <span class="s">The only undesirable thing they had, it was a shameful secret.</span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>If anyone were to ever hear about Potter , they were convinced they 
            <span class="dif" id="n7">just do not
               call .
            </span>
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley 's sister , but both had not seen since the wedding of
            Mrs. Potter.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">In fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended that she was an only child , because her sister
            and her good for nothing husband were as far away as possible from what was a
            Dursley .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">The Dursleys trembled with fear at the thought of what would the neighbors
            think if by misfortune Potter 
            <span class="dif" id="n8">showed their street</span> .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">They knew that Potter , too, had a little boy , but they had never seen.</span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Its existence constituted an additional reason to keep Potter away : there was
            no question that the little Dudley starts to 
            <span class="dif" id="n9">attend</span> a child like that .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the morning of Tuesday when this story begins
            , it
            was gray and sad and nothing in the cloudy sky could have predicted that strange and
            mysterious things would soon occur across the country .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Mr. Dursley hummed a tune tying 
            <span class="dif" id="n10">its</span> most sinister tie for work and Mrs Dursley
            teasingly told the latest gossip in the neighborhood trying to install 
            <span class="dif" id="n11">it</span> 
            <span class="dif" id="n12">on</span> his
            highchair young Dudley bawling all the strength of his lungs.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">None of them noticed the big bronze owl 
            <span class="dif" id="n13">plumage</span> 
            <span class="dif" id="n14">fluttered</span> past the window .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>At half past eight , Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase , kissed on the cheek
            
            <span class="dif" id="n999">and Mrs. Dursley</span> tried to kiss Dudley, but without success, as 
            <span class="dif" id="n15">it</span> was facing a
            tantrum and applied to throw against the wall of the room the contents of his plate
            grain .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Sacred little man chuckled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">He got into his car and backed down the driveway leading 
            <span class="dif" id="n16">to</span> the house.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">It was in the corner he noticed for the first time an unusual detail : a cat
            reading a map.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="dif" id="n17">Revérifia</span> it and saw that the cat was there but no trace of road map , he 
            <span class="dif" id="n18">had
               fooled
            </span> by the sun's reflection .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="dif" id="n19">Mrs.</span> Dursley continued to observe the cat in his mirror .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>The animal was reading the plate indicating " Privet Drive " - but no, see , he
            did not read it 
            <span class="dif" id="n20">i watched / i plate </span>.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Cats can not read maps or signs.</span>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley pulled himself together and concentrated his thoughts on the big
            control drills he was hoping to get that day .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>But when he reached the outskirts of the city drove something other drills his
            head, he noticed the presence of several bystanders dressed in a strange way : they
            wore capes .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Mr. Dursley could not bear people - young had shifted some of these
            
            <span class="dif" id="n21">accoutrements</span> !
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">He thought it was a particularly stupid new fashion but Mr Dursley was angry
            when he saw that two of them were not young at all.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>This man, there was certainly older than him, which did not prevent him wearing
            a emerald green cloak .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">What 
            <span class="dif" id="n22">impudence</span> !
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Mr. Dursley as he must have thought an animated street, these people were there
            to raise money for the benefit of 
            <span class="dif" id="n23">any</span> work .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="dif" id="n24">This could be it .</span>

         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Mr. Dursley finally put it in the parking Grunnings .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Drills had taken place in his thoughts.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">In his office on the eighth floor , Mr. Dursley always sat back to the window
            .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Had it been otherwise, 
            <span class="dif" id="n26">he</span> would probably have been a little harder than usual
            to concentrate on his drills, this morning.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>He did not see the owls flying on the wing but 
            <span class="dif" id="n27">passers</span> 
            <span class="dif" id="n28">them</span>, saw them.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Mr. Dursley , however, noticed nothing unusual and no owl did not 
            <span class="dif" id="n29">come</span> to
            disturb his morning.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>He sharply 
            <span class="dif" id="n30">rebuked</span> a half-dozen employees, spent several major blows over and
            pushed a few more screams.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>He felt a good mood until lunchtime where he thought it would be good to

            <span class="ast">*</span>They too excited whispering of air and he did not see any box for collecting
            money .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">When he left the shop with a big donut wrapped in a bag , he heard a few words
            of their conversation.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- The Potters , that's right, that's what I heard ...</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- Yes, their son Harry ...</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- A damn good sorcerer, if you want to know ...</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley stopped, overcome by a sudden fear and he quickly crossed the
            street , shut himself up in his office while telling his secretary not to disturb
            him, seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing the home when he changed
            his mind.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He would speak to Mrs. Dursley tonight, any allusion to his sister put her in
            such a state !
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">This afternoon , he found it much more difficult to concentrate on these drills
            and when he left the office at five o'clock, he was still so worried that someone
            
            <span class="dif" id="n34">knocked</span> at the door.
         </span>

      <p>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>- Heartbroken , he muttered the old tiny man he failed to do 
            <span class="dif" id="n35">fell</span>.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">To the great displeasure of Mr. Dursley , the man wore a purple cape and he
            replied in a shrill voice that earned him the attention of passers :
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- Do not be sorry , my dear sir.</span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>Nothing today can not make me angry .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Rejoice , because You-Know- Who has finally disappeared.</span>
         
         <span class="s">Even Muggles like you should celebrate this happy, happy day!</span>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley wondered what that meant " muggle ".</span>
         
         <span class="s">He hurried back into his car and took the road to the house.</span>
         
         <span class="s">
            <span class="ast">*</span>When 
            <span class="dif" id="n36">engaged</span> in went from 4 Privet Drive, he saw that the cat was still there,
            in a bad mood , he took a broom in the garage and 
            <span class="dif" id="n37">drove</span> the cat , who had a stern
            look , the garden of his house.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Mr Dursley could finally return to his home.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">During dinner , Mrs. Dursley told him the latest gossip of the neighborhood and
            
            <span class="dif" id="n38">it</span> also reported that Dudley had learned a new word : " 
            <span class="dif" id="n39">not</span>! " He sat in the living
            room and 
            <span class="dif" id="n40">looked</span> at the end of the newscast :
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- According to testimony from various regions , it seems that 
            <span class="dif" id="n41">the</span> owls have
            behaved in a very strange way during the day, said the presenter.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Normally , owls are nocturnal 
            <span class="dif" id="n42">raptors</span>, it is rare to see  in daylight.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Today, however, hundreds of witnesses saw these birds flying around since
            sunrise.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">That is mysterious, the presenter concluded by authorizing a smile.</span>
         
         <span class="s">And now came the time of the weather , with forecasts 
            <span class="dif" id="n43">of</span> Jim McGuffin .
         </span>

            <span class="ast">*</span>So Jim , is what we should expect further 
            <span class="dif" id="n44">falls</span>  owls during the next night.

      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- That I would not be able to tell you , Ted, said the man on the weather , but
            know in any case that the owls are not the only  was to behave in a strange way .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Viewers who live in remote areas as each other as Kent, Yorkshire and the east
            coast of Scotland telephoned me to say that instead of the rain I had planned for
            today, they have real meteor showers !
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Maybe it was  bonfire , although this is not yet the season.</span>
         
         <span class="s">Anyway, you can be sure that the time of the next night will be very wet.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley froze in his chair.</span>
         
         <span class="s">Of meteor showers all over the country ?</span>
         
         <span class="s">Owls flying by daylight ?</span>
         
         <span class="s">Weird people wearing capes ?</span>
         
         <span class="s">And these murmurs , whispers 
            <span class="dif" id="n45">on</span> the Potter ...
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">That finally convinced Mr. Dursley 
            <span class="dif" id="n46">talking</span> to Mrs. Dursley who had just entered
            the room with two cups of tea .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s">Mr. Dursley , a little nervous, cleared his throat .</span>

         <span class="s">As expected, his wife looked shocked and angry .</span>
         
         <span class="s">She always pretended not to have a sister.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- No, she replied dryly.</span>

      <p>
         
         <span class="s">- I've seen strange men this day , he wore capes , there's also stories of owls
            and shooting stars.

         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Her husband wondered if he would dare tell

         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Ah yes , said Mr Dursley felt his heart stop.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Yes, I agree with you.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He did not say another word about it as they climbed the stairs to go to
            bed.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window
            and cast a glance in the garden.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The cat came back and watched the street as if waiting for someone.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Dursley imagined there things ?</span>

         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">No, he could never bear .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He lay in his bed with his wife , he slept in his bed.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In the street , the cat on the wall , he showed no signs of drowsiness.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He sat motionless as a statue, laying his eyes wide open in the corner of
            Privet Drive.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">There was not the slightest reaction when car door slammed in the next street ,
            nor when two owls passed over his head.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It was almost midnight when he finally moved.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A man appeared on the corner of the street that the cat had been watching all
            this time .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He appeared so suddenly and so quietly that seem to have out of the ground
            .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The cat's tail quivered , his eyes narrowed.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">We had never seen in Privet Drive something like this man .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver color of his hair and his
            beard down to his waist.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He was wearing a long dress , a purple cloak that swept the ground and wearing
            high-heeled boots , buckled .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Its blue and bright eyes sparkled behind half-moon spectacles and his long
            hooked nose gave the impression of having been broken at least twice.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He was busy looking for something in his long cloak , but seemed to realize he
            was being watched , because he suddenly looked up at the cat who was still staring
            at him on the other side of the street.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">For some reason , the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He chuckled and muttered :</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I should have guessed .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He had found what he sought in an inner pocket , there was a silver lighter
            .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He lifted his cap , handed over his head and lit it twelve times.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">All streetlights then extinguished one by one in a small slam .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Once the street plunged into complete darkness , he walked to No. 4.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">When it was reached , he sat on the wall next to the cat.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He did not give him a look , but after a moment's silence, he spoke :</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- It's fun to see you here, Professor McGonagall he said.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He turned his head to send a smile to chat but it was gone.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore smiled at present in a severe-looking woman with square glasses.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She also wore an emerald green cape .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Her hair was pulled tight bun and she looked strangely annoyed.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- How did you know it was me ?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">she asked .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- My dear Professor , I 've never seen a cat take such a steep manner.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- You too would be a bit steep if you stay sitting all day on a brick wall,
            said Professor McGonagall .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- All day ?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">While you could celebrate with others?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Coming here , I have seen a dozen feasts and banquets.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall snorted angrily .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Yes, I know , everyone partied , she said with annoyance.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">You would think they would be more careful, but no, not at all!</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Even Muggles have noticed that something was happening .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">They have spoken to the news.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She showed a nod the living room window of Dursley , in darkness .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I heard myself.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">They reported the theft of owls ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">meteor showers ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Muggles are not completely stupid.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It was inevitable that they might notice.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Shooting stars in Kent !</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I bet it is still a favorite Dedalus Diggle .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He never had a lot of gumption .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- You can not blame them , 'said Dumbledore gently.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">We have not had much to celebrate for eleven years.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I know , 'said Professor McGonagall sternly , but it is not a reason to lose
            your head.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">All these people were madly imprudent .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Walking through the streets in broad daylight, to exchange the latest news
            without even taking the precaution to dress like muggles !
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">She cast a sidelong glance at Dumbledore and piercing , as if she hoped he
            would say something, but he remained silent .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- We would be in trouble , 'she said then, if the day You -Know-Who seems to
            have finally disappeared, muggles learned our existence.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I guess he really gone , is not it , Dumbledore .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- It seems that this is so, indeed assured Dumbledore.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">And we have every reason to congratulate ourselves .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">How about an Eskimo Lemon ?</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- A what?</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- An Eskimo Lemon .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">This is a treat that makes the Muggle and I must say it is pretty good.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Thank you, not for me, coldly replied Professor McGonagall seemed to feel
            that the time was not ripe to eat ice lemon .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I told you that even if you know who 's really gone ...</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- My dear teacher, someone so reasonable that you should not hesitate to
            pronounce his name?
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Do not you think ?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">This way of saying " You Know Who " has no meaning .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">For eleven years , I tried to convince people of the called by name :
            Voldemort.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall grimaced but Dumbledore had left two Eskimo Lemon did not
            seem to notice.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- If we continue to say " You Know Who ", we will end up creating
            confusion.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I see no reason to be afraid to say Voldemort's name .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I know you do not see , 'said McGonagall seemed half exasperated , half
            admiring .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">But you 're different.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Everyone knows you 're the only one to have never scared You Know Who ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">or Voldemort if you insist .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- You flatter me , Dumbledore said in a quiet voice .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Voldemort has powers that I have ever had.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- This is simply because you have too much ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">say nobility to make use of .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Fortunately it is night .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I never blushed so much since the day when Madam Pomfrey told me she was my new
            earmuffs lovely .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Owls , this is nothing compared to the rumors , she said .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">You know what everyone says about the reasons for his disappearance ?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">What eventually stop ?</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Apparently , Professor McGonagall had to broach the subject that he held
            closest to his heart , the real reason had decided to wait all day , sitting on a
            cold wall.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">For never a cat or a woman had fixed a penetrating look that Professor at this
            moment .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Obviously, she would not believe what everyone said as Dumbledore would have
            not confirmed that this was the truth.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- What to say , continued the professor, is that last night Voldemort came to
            Godric's Hollow to seek the Potter.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">According to the rumor , Lily and James Potter are ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">well, they say they are ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">dead ...</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore nodded.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall was struggling to catch his breath .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Lily and James ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I do not believe it ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I do not want to admit it ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Oh, Albus ...</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore reached out and patted her shoulder.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I know ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I know ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">he said gravely .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- And that 's not all , she said in a trembling voice .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">They say he tried to kill Harry, the son of Potter.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">But it was not.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It failed to remove this toddler.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore nodded gloomily .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- This is ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">is this true?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Muttered Professor McGonagall.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">After everything he did ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">all the people he killed ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">he has not managed to kill a little boy ?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It is amazing ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">nothing else had been able to stop ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">but for heaven's sake , why is it that Harry is able to survive ?</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- You can only make assumptions, Dumbledore said , we will never know
            maybe.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and wiped his eyes under
            his glasses.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore deep breath and looked at his watch and said :</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Hagrid 's late.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In fact, I imagine that it was he who told you I'd be here .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Yes, admitted McGonagall , and I suppose you will not tell me why you came to
            that specific location.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I came to trust Harry 's last family life now .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- You mean ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">impossible!</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Not the people who live in the house she said, pointing the finger 4 .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore, you can do it , I watched all day.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">You can not imagine more different than we are .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In addition , they have a son ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I saw him kicking his mother walking along the street screaming demanding
            candy.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter come and live here!</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- This is the best place for Harry, Dumbledore replied in a firm tone .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">His uncle and aunt explain him when he is older .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">I wrote them a letter .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- After all , you should know what you do and then it will keep it away from
            the media and Rita Skeeter .
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Thank you for your trust , Professor Dumbledore replied .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- How will it happen?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Asked McGonagall.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- This is Hagrid must bring , said Dumbledore.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- And you think it is wise to entrust such an important task to Hagrid .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I would trust my life to Hagrid , Dumbledore assured .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- I'm not saying it lacks heart , said Professor McGonagall grudgingly , but
            acknowledge that it is quite careless.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It tends to ...</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">What is that?</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">A low growl broke the silence of the night .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The noise increased intensity while they scrutinized the street on both sides
            to try to see the light of a lighthouse.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The rumble turned into crackling over their heads.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">They then looked up and saw a huge motorcycle fall from the sky and landed in
            front of them on the road.
         </span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The bike was huge, but it was nothing compared to the man who sat on .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It was two times larger than average and five times wider.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It was like a wild, with her long black shaggy hair, his beard that completely
            hid his face, his hands the size of a dustbin lid and feet shod in leather boots
            that looked like baby dolphins .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">The man was holding a pile of blankets in his huge muscular arms .</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- Hagrid , Dumbledore said with relief.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">You 're finally here .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Where did you researched this bike ?</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">No problem ?</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">- The 've borrowed , Professor Dumbledore replied the giant down with care of
            the bike , it is the young Sirius Black who lent me .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Otherwise, the house was almost completely destroyed, but I managed to get out
            of there before the Muggles begin to replicate.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He fell asleep when we flew over Bristol.</span>

         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Hagrid 's shoulders shook , Professor McGonagall blinked furiously , and the

         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Goodnight teachers.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Wiping with the back of his neck streaming eyes , Hagrid got on the bike and
            started the engine started.

         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">In response, Professor McGonagall blew her nose .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Dumbledore turned and walked away down the street.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He stopped at the corner and took the extinguisher in his pocket money.</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">He operated once and a dozen bright balls immediately returned to the lamps
            .
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Privet Drive was suddenly bathed in orange light and Dumbledore distinguished
            silhouette of a cat which turned the corner of the street.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">It also saw the pile of blankets in front of the door number 4.</span>

         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter turned in his blankets without waking up .</span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Her small hand closed on the letter placed beside him and he continued to sleep
            without knowing it was an exceptional human being , without knowing he was already
            famous.
         </span>
         
         <span class="s" style="font-style: italic;">Nor did he know that even now , people had gathered in secret all over the
            country and they raised their glasses , murmuring: " To the health of Harry
