                <div class="lingHeader2">Linguistics | an introduction</div> Often times, people think linguists are translators. This is a
            misconception. Linguistics is the scientific study of language. While linguists may study and learn foreign languages as part of their work,
            the field is broader than these tasks. Saeed (2003) describes how linguists have traditionally defined languages in modules. The diagram to the left
            is a variation of his own hierarchial representation of these modules (p. 9). Each of its elements are described in detail below. Pursue the 
            following descriptions to gain a better understanding of how linguists think of language. Morphological, syntactic, and semantic concepts will be used extensively throughout
            this research project.</div>

            <div class="para1">
                <div class="lingHeader3">Phonetics | [fəˈnɛtɪks]</div> "Phonetics is the study of
                the minimal units that make up language. For spoken language these are the sounds of
                speech -- the consonants, vowels, melodies, and rythms" (Mihalcek and Wilson, 2011,
                p. 36). Different languages contain different sets of possible speech sounds. For
                instance, French contains nasalized vowels that English, German, and Slovak do not.
                The English "shhh" sound, in words such as <i>Chicago</i> and <i>slush</i> does not
                exist in Slovak. On the other hand, the trilled Slovak "r," in <i>zmrzlina</i> ("ice
                cream") and <i>štvrtok</i> ("Thursday"), is not present in any of the other three
                languages. A further issue is that alphabets often times do not accurately reflect
                phonetic information. English is a notorious example of this. Note that the
                character "a" in <i>c<b>a</b>t</i> versus <i>anim<b>a</b>l</i> versus
                    <i>Asi<b>a</b></i> represents very different vowel sounds!</div>
            <div class="para1">Linguists discuss different languages in relation to each other all
                the time, and its important that they have means to accurately discern speech sounds
                in these discussions. In <b>articulatory phonetics</b>, linguists can discuss
                speeech sounds by how they are physiologically produced, or in <b>acoustic
                    phonetics</b>, linguists can discuss sounds in terms of their physical
                properties (Mihalcek and Wilson, 2011, p 36). For the purpose of universally
                representing all the sounds of the world's languages, the International Phonetic
                Association developed the International Phonetic Alphabet or IPA system. It is an
                alphabetic system of notation which attempts to establish individual characters for
                every physical speech sound or <b>phoneme</b> (IPA, <i>Handbook</i>).</div>

            <div class="para1">
                <div class="lingHeader3">Phonology | /phonology/</div> Phonetics is concerned with
                the physical properties of speech sounds. Phonology is concerned with how speakers
                of a language mentally represent physical speech sounds in their head. For instance,
                does <i>cat</i> end with the same speech sound that the word <i>take</i> starts
                with? Most native English speakers would respond, "Yes!" However, on closer
                examination, we find that this is not the case. The "t" in <i>take</i> is aspirated
                while the "t" in <i>cat</i> is not. Native English speakers can test this. Pronounce
                each world with your palm facing your mouth at a distance of 1-2 inches. You'll feel
                a puff of air as you pronounce the "t" in <i>take</i> but not in pronouncing the "t"
                in <i>cat</i>. For native English speakers, the difference between these two
                    <b>phonemes</b> is not meaningful, and they both are part of the same
                    <b>allophone</b>, or mental representation (Odden, 2005, p. 2-3, 44).</div>

                Morphology is the study of the internal structure of words (Katamba and
                Stonam, 2006, p. 3). Syntax is the study is how words are assembled or ordered to
                build grammatical phrase and sentence structures (Carnie, 2013, p. 4). There is
                extensive interaction between these two language modules. </div>
            <div class="para1">Consider the English word <i>color</i>. It can be a noun which refers
                to physically properties such as "red," "green," "orange," etc. or a verb meaning
                "to add color." Morphological markers may be added to <i>color</i> to produce new
                words with new meanings, for instance, <i>color<b>-ful</b></i> and
                        <i>color<b>-less</b></i>. From one noun, suddenly we have an array of
                adjectives. To the verb <i>color</i>, we can add markings which indicate features
                such as person or tense: "He <i>color<b>s</b></i>," "The girl is
                    <i>color<b>ing</b></i> drawings," "They <i>color<b>ed</b></i>." Now consider the
                following sentences: "The pages were <i><b>un</b>color<b>ed</b></i>," "The
                        <i><b>un</b>color<b>ed</b></i> pages were thrown out," "The
                        <i><b>dis</b>color<b>ed</b></i> paper can be recycled." Through
                morphological marking, a verb (arguably) becomes an adjective, certainly more so in
                the last two sentences than the first.</div>
            <div class="para1">In the above examples, there are a lot of constraints on where or in
                what order the different <i>color</i> derivations are able to appear in a sentence.
                "He <i>colorful</i>" and "The girl is <i>uncolored</i> drawings" are ungrammatical
                sentences. The famous syntactician Noam Chomsky coined the following two
                sentences:</div>
            <div class="example"> (1) <i>The coloress green ideas sleep furiously.</i><br /> (2)
                    <i>Furiously sleep ideas green colorless.</i></div>
            <div class="para1">The first is grammatical but nonsensical. The second is both
                nonsensical and ungrammatical ("Colorless green ideas do not sleep furiously -- or
                do they?" 2008). Syntactic rules govern speakers' perception of grammaticality in
                their native language. Of course, the examples so far are restricted to English. It
                is important to be aware that meaning and grammaticality is encoded into
                morphological and syntactic modules differently across languages. English has little
                morphology compared to the Slavic languages where case marking is extensive.
                Consider the following sentences:</div>
            <div class="example"> (1) <i>Robert hit Maria.</i><br /> (2) <i>Maria hit Robert.</i>
            </div>
            <div class="para1">The syntactic ordering is altered between the two sentences, and this
                in turn drastically alters their meaning. In the first, Robert is the subject and
                Mara is the direct object, i.e., the recipient of Robert's hitting. In the second,
                Maria is the subject, and Robert is the recipient of Maria's hitting. Grammatical
                rules in Slovak would forbid the same syntactic switch from resulting in the same
                meaning switch. Instead, the meaning switch would have to be encoded by case
                marking.</div>
            <div class="example"> (1a) <i>Robert bije Mariu.</i><br /> (1b) <i>Mariu Robert
                    bije.</i><br /> (1c) <i>Mariu bije Robert.</i><br /><br />(2a) <i>Maria bije
                    Roberta.</i><br /> (2b) <i>Maria Roberta bije.</i><br /> (2c) <i>Roberta bije
                    Maria.</i>

            <div class="para1">In sentence 1a to 1c, Robert undergoes no morphological change and
                thus is in the nominative case, meaning he is the sentence subject. Maria is the
                recipient of the action "hit." The "-a" to -u feminine singular ending change marks
                her as the direct object, and changing the order of the sentence does not over ride
                the meaning behind this morphology. Conversely, in sentences 2a to 2c, Robert is the
                direct object, as marked by the masculine animate singular suffix "-a." In general,
                the accusative case marks the direct object in Slovak in addition to many other
                semantic features. There are 4 further cases in Slovak: the genitive, the locative,
                the instrumental, and the dative.</div>

            <div class="para1"><div class="lingHeader3">Semantics | ∃x(L(x) ∧ S(x))</div> "Semantics
                is the study of meaning communicated through language" (Saeed, 2003, p. 3). A person
                can read a sentence and understand all of its phonological, morphological, and
                syntactic elements but discerning its meaning often times involve navigating
                ambiguity. For instance, consider the English sentence, "I saw the man with
                telescope." Is "the man" holding a telescope? Or did the speaker use a telescope to
                see him?</div>
            <div class="para1">Logic is used to develop notation intended to clarify ambiguity in
                <b>formal semantics</b>. An example of such notation in our header. Where L indicates "is a
                linguist" and S indicates "studies Semantics," the notation means that there are
                some linguists who study semantics, but not all linguists necessarily study
                semantics. This meaning is subtlely but exactly different from other ambiguous English
                sentences such as, "Linguists study semantics" or "Every linguist studies semantics"
                or "Semantics is studied by linguists."</div>
            <div class="para1">A distinction can be made between <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect</b>
                speech. For instance, "Do the dishes," "Will you please do the dishes?" and "Gee!
                The dishes are really piling up" are all sentences with very different surface
                forms. The first is an imperative, the second a request, and the last is an
                observation. However, depending on <b>context</b>, all three sentences may have the same
                semantic core: the addresser is communicating to the addressee that he should do the
                dishes.</div>
            <div class="para1">In comparing two languages, phonetic, phonological, morphological,
                and syntactic elements assemble differently in the languages to produce elements
                with unique surface forms that nevertheless convey a corresponding if not equivalent
                meaning. Compare the following English and Slovak:
            </div>
            <div class="example">(1) <i>Do Žiliny pôjdeme autobusom.</i> <br />
                <i>into Žilina</i><sub>-gen,fem,sing</sub> <i>go</i><sub>-fut</sub> 
                <sub>-1per,pl</sub> <i>bus</i><sub>-ins,mas,sing</sub>
                <br /> (2) <i>We will take the bus to Žilina</i>. <br />
                (3) <i>We will go by bus to Žilina</i>.
            </div>
            <div class="para1">The Slovak verb for "to take" <i>vziať</i> could not have the second meaing that the English verb "to take" has
            in sentence 2. Note that "the bus" is the direct object in sentence two. In sentence three, "the bus" is not a direct object; it's 
            an instrument and is marked as such by the instrumental case marking "-om." When "the bus" appears as an instrument in English, 
            no such morphological marking is possible and instead this feature is marked with the preposition "by."</div>

                between the modules listed above, they interact top to bottom and bottom to top. That linguists are attempting to scientifically describe language
                with language presents an interesting dynamic!  Throughout this project, we will be using concepts from primarily morphology, syntax, and semantics,
           in developing hypotheses, methodology, and in understanding the results of our analysis.
