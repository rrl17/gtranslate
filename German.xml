        <p>
            <s tr="0">The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but they also had a secret , and

            <s tr="0">Mrs. Dursley even claimed that she had no sister , because <dif id="9"

            <s tr="1">The Dursleys shuddered at the thought of what the neighbors would say , the

            <s tr="1">Also, this boy was a good reason to stay away from the Potters , with such a
