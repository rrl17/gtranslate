        <h2>Where we talk about how lame google translate is. </h2>
        <p>If you've ever taken a foreign language course, or gone to a website in a foreign
            language, you've probably tried google-translating foreign text into English. And you've
            probably been confused by the result. We certainly have.</p>
        <p>In our project, we attempt to discover what in foreign languages google finds so
            difficult to translate, and in which languages it finds more success.</p>
