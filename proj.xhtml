        <h2>Where we talk about how lame google translate is. </h2>
        <p>If you've ever taken a foreign language course, or gone to a website in a foreign
            language, you've probably tried google-translating foreign text into English. And you've
            probably been confused by the result. We certainly have.</p>
        <p>In our project, we attempt to discover what in foreign languages google finds so
            difficult to translate, and in which languages it finds more success.</p>
        <p>We are each looking at the first chapter of Harry Potter translated into French, German
            and Slovak. Using google translate, we are translating the translations back into
            English and comparing the google translated version with the input text to find out
            where google fails the most and which errors are the most prevelant for each
            language.</p>
