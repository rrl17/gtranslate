            <s tr="1">No one would have thought that they could get caught up in a strange and

        <p>
            <s tr="0">Mr. Dursley was the director of a company called Grunnings that

            <s tr="0">Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had twice as much neck as might have
                been necessary , but this was very useful because <dif id="2" pos="pro" type="per"

            <s tr="0">The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their eyes there was

        </p>
        <p>
            <s tr="0">The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but they also had a secret , and

            <s tr="1">Simply unbearable , if the thing would come out with the Potters would be
                .</s>
            <s tr="0">Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley 's sister , but the two had not seen each
                other for many years.</s>
            <s tr="0">Mrs. Dursley even claimed that she had no sister , because <dif id="9" pos="pro"

            <s tr="1">The Dursleys shuddered at the thought of what the neighbors would say , the
                Potters one day should show up in their street .</s>
            <s tr="0">The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, but they had never
                seen <dif id="13" pos="pro" type="del"/> before.</s>
            <s tr="1">Also, this boy was a good reason to stay away from the Potters , with such
                a child you should not come into contact Dudley .</s>

            <s tr="1">Mr. Dursley hummed and looked for work his most boring tie , and Mrs.

        <p>
            <s tr="1">At the street corner, he noticed for the first time something strange - a cat

            <s tr="0">For a moment Mr. Dursley was not clear what he had seen - then he turned

            <s tr="0">At the <dif id="32" pos="n" type="mst">inflection</dif> to Privet Drive was a tabby cat, but a road map could not be

            <s tr="0">The cat stared back.</s>
            <s tr="1">While Mr. Dursley <ins>came</ins> around the corner and down the street drove , he watched
